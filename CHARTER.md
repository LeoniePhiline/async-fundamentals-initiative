# ðŸ“œ async fn fundamentals Charter
<!--
 Provide an introduction summarising the goals and motivation behind your
 initiative.
-->

This initiative is part of the wg-async-foundations [vision process].

* Able to write `async fn` in traits and trait impls
    * Able to easily declare that `T: Trait + Send` where "every async fn in `Trait` returns a `Send` future"
    * Traits that use `async fn` can still be [dyn safe][dyn async trait] though some tuning may be required
    * Async functions in traits desugar to [impl Trait in traits]
* Able to write ["async fn drop"][async drop] to declare that the destructor may await
* Support for [async closures]

## Proposal

Feel free to move some elements, like design questions that came up,
into the approriate section.
