# Naming futures

## Status

Seems unlikely to be adopted. Doesn't *feel* right, and doesn't give any expanded abilities, such as the ability to name the future type.

## Summary

The challenge is to be able to name the future that results from a particular async function. This can be used, for example, when naming future types, or perhaps as part of [bounding futures].

It is likely that this problem is best solved in the context of the [impl trait initiative].
